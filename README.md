## EXP NO:7 C PROGRAM TO PRINT TEN SPACE-SEPARATED INTEGERS IN A SINGLE LINE DENOTING THE FREQUENCY OF EACH DIGIT FROM 0 TO 3 . 
## Aim: To write a C program to print ten space-separated integers in a single line denoting the frequency of each digit from 0 to 3.
## Algorithm:

Start
Declare char array a[50] outer loop for each digit from 0 to 3
Initialize counter c to 0
For each character in the string print count c for current digit, followed by a space
Increment h to move to the next digit

## Aim: To write a C program to print all of its permutations in strict lexicographical order.

## Algorithm:

Start

Declare variables s (pointer to an array of strings) and n (number of strings)

Memory Allocation Dynamically allocate memory for s to store an array of strings

Input Read the number of strings n from the user Dynamically allocate memory for each string in s

Permutation Generation Loop

Memory Deallocation Free the memory allocated for each string in s Free the memory allocated for s

End

 ## EXP NO:10 C PROGRAM TO FIND A SQUARE OF NUMBER USING FUNCTION WITHOUT ARGUMENTS WITH RETURN TYPE

## Aim:

To write a C program that calculates the square of a number using a function that does not take any arguments, but returns the square of the number.

## Algorithm:

Start.
Define a function square() with no parameters. This function will return an integer value.
Inside the function: o Declare an integer variable to store the number. o Ask the user to input a number. o Calculate the square of the number (multiply the number by itself). o Return the squared value.
In the main function: o Call the square() function and display the result.
End.
